# Build as CMLFS

# Setting the dynamic linker configuration option in Clang
# will cause static executables to segfault. As an alternative
# for setting the dynamic linker/linux-loader/interpreter, build
# patchelf as it maynot be available on the host.

# Configure source
CC=clang CXX=clang++ \
./configure --prefix=/cgnutools

# Compile
make

# Install to llvmtools
