# Most compilers provide a way to disable the 
# default behavior for finding the standard 
# library and to override it with custom paths. 
# With Clang, this can be done with:

clang++ -nostdinc++ -nostdlib++           \
        -isystem <install>/include/c++/v1 \
        -L <install>/lib                  \
        -Wl,-rpath,<install>/lib          \
        -lc++                             \
        test.cpp
