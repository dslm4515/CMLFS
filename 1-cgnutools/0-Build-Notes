# General Build Notes for cgnutools

# Builds for cgnutools assume the following:
# o bash is the shell in use
# o sh is a symbolic link to bash
# o /usr/bin/awk is a symbolic link to gawk
# o /usr/bin/yacc is a symbolic link to bison
#   or a script that executes bison
# o flex is required when building source snapshots of GCC

echo $SHELL
file /bin/sh
file /usr/bin/awk
file /usr/bin/yacc
which flex

# Make sure building cgnutools as cmlfs
whoami

# Make sure PATH is set correctly:
export PATH=/cgnutools/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

# Each package should be unpacked in /mnt/cmlfs/source and change 
# to the unpacked source directory. For example:
cd /mnt/cmlfs/sources
tar xf pkgs/foo-1.2.3.tar.gz
cd foo-1.2.3

# Then patch and compile per instruction
patch -Np1 -i ../patches/foo-mlfs/fix-it.patch
./configure --prefix=/cgnutools
make 
make install

# After the package is installed, change directories and remove
# unpacked source directory unless instructed:
cd ..
rm -rf foo-1.2.3
