# General Build Notes for llvmtools

# As before, everything should be built by cmlfs user

# llvmtools will be built enough to enter chroot.

# Cross-gcc has built the following for llvmtools:
# o kernel headers
# o musl libc [headers+libraries]
# o zlib-ng
# o libatomic-chimera

# cgnutools contains the following:
# o cross-gcc [built by mussel, disabled in favor for clang]
# o stage 0 clang
#    - libunwind
#    - libc++abi
#    - libc++
#    - compiler-rt
#    - lld
#    - clang

# Since stage0 clang is now built, it will build stage1 clang with out any
# dependency on gcc (libgcc_s & libstdc++) with sysroot at llvmtools.
# The rest of llvmtools will be built in order to chroot with just llvmtools.

# All binaries should build with `/llvmtools/lib/ld-musl-$(uname -m).so.1` as
# the dynamic [linux] loader/linker. Nothing should link to any libraries in
# cgnutools.

# Since binutils will be replaced with LLVM's binary tools [for llvmtools],
# There are still packages that are hard coded for GNU's binutils. Symlinks
# will be made to force those packages to use the LLVM counterparts.

# Chroot environment needs:
# o Compiler = clang
# o Binary utilities = LLVM or elftoolchain
# o Shell = Dash or bash
# o core utilities (i.e. ls): coreutils
# o Utilities to unpack sources:
#    - *.tar = tar
#    - *.xz = xz-utils
#    - *.gz = gzip
#    - *.bz2 = bzip2
# o make = GNU Make. Required for compiling the linux kernel
# o patching = GNU patch
# o Utils for finding diffs = diffutils
# o Search utils = findutils
# o Utility to search contents of file = GNU's grep
# o macro processor = GNU's M4 
# o Manipulate files = Gawk 
# o Stream editor = sed
# o test utilities (optional) = tcl, expect, dejagnu
# o text editor (optional) = vim or nano
