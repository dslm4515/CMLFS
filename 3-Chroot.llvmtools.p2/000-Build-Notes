# General Build Notes for chroot

# llvmtools has been built with the minimal packages
# to enter a chroot. A chroot will prevent any built
# packages from linking back to the host's software.

# After entering chroot, the first order of business
# is to build packages for testing [if desired] and
# any packages needed to build the stage 2 clang,
# also known as the final system's default compiler.

# Once stage 2 clang its built, all packages built
# for the final system should use the dynamic
# linux loader/linker in /lib/ld-$(uname -m)-musl.so.1

# For those who are familiar build LFS or MLFS, the
# build approach differs: the packages used for testing
# just-build packages will be built under chroot and
# can be optionally installed on the final system.

# Now is a good time to add packages for a package
# manager so that package tracking can start right
# away as the final system is built.

# This is also a good time to backup llvmtools if
# building another system with the same CPU archecture.
# This can be accomplished with:
cd $CMLFS
tar Jcpf llvmtools-$(uname -u)-backup.txz llvmtools
