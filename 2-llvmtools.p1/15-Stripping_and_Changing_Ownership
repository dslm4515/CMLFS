# Stripping
# This step is optional, but if the CMLFS partition
# is rather small, it is beneficial to learn that
# unnecessary items can be removed. The executables
# and libraries built so far contain about 70 MB
# of unneeded debugging symbols.

/usr/bin/find /llvmtools/bin/ -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec \
     /cgnutools/bin/${TARGET_TUPLE}-strip --strip-debug {} \;
/usr/bin/find /llvmtools/lib/ -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec \
     /cgnutools/bin/${TARGET_TUPLE}-strip --strip-debug {} \;

# Remove the documentation:
rm -rf /llvmtools/{,share}/{info,man,doc}

# Remove unneeded files:
find /llvmtools/{lib,libexec} -name \*.la -delete

# Changing Ownership
# Currently, the $CMLFS/llvmtools directory is owned
# by the user cmlfs, a user that exists only on the
# host system. If the $CMLFS/llvmtools directory is kept
# as is, the files are owned by a user ID without
# a corresponding account. This is dangerous because
# a user account created later could get this same
# user ID and would own the $CMLFS/llvmtools directory
# and all the files therein, thus exposing these
# files to possible malicious manipulation.

# To avoid this issue, you could add the cmlfs user
# to the new CMLFS system later when creating the
# /etc/passwd file, taking care to assign it the
# same user and group IDs as on the host system.

# ************************************************
# The commands in the remainder of this build must
# be performed while logged in as user root and
# no longer as user cmlfs. Also, double check that
# $MLFS is set in root's environment.
# ************************************************

# Change the ownership of the $CMLFS/llvmtools directory
# to user root by running the following command:
chown -R root:root $CMLFS/llvmtools
