# General Build Notes for llvmtools

# As before, everything should be built by cmlfs user

# Cross-gcc has built the following for llvmtools:
# o kernel headers
# o musl libc [headers+libraries]
# o zlib-ng
# o libatomic-chimera
# o fortify headers

# cgnutools contains the following:
# o cross-gcc [built by mussel, disabled in favor for clang]
# o stage 2 clang
#    - libunwind
#    - libc++abi
#    - libc++
#    - compiler-rt
#    - lld
#    - clang

# Since stage0 clang is now built, it will build stage1 clang with out any
# dependency on gcc (libgcc_s & libstdc++) with sysroot at llvmtools.
# The rest of llvmtools will be built in order to chroot with just llvmtools.

# All binaries should build with `/llvmtools/lib/ld-musl-$(uname -m).so.1` as
# the dynamic [linux] loader/linker. Nothing should link to any libraries in
# cgnutools.
