# Final System: Meson
# Build under chroot

# NOTE: None of the packages in CMLFS are built with meson.
#       But, a lot of packages outside of CMLFS use meson.

# Build
pip3 wheel -w dist --no-build-isolation --no-deps $PWD

# Install
pip3 install --no-index --find-links dist meson
install -vDm644 data/shell-completions/bash/meson /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/meson
install -vDm644 data/shell-completions/zsh/_meson /usr/share/zsh/site-functions/_meson
