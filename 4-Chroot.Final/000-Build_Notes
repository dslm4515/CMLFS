# General Build Notes for chroot

# To build stage2 clang, the following need to be built first:
# o Kernel headers (required for compiling in general)
# o Musl Libc (built clang will expect it in /lib)
# o Zlib-ng (compression for debug symbols)
# o zstd (optional conpression support)
# o net-bsd-curses (optional terminal support)

# Then elftoolchain to replace GNU's Binutils
# o python -> needs libffi
# o lsb-tools -> python
